## Description ##
This repository contains the source code for a dynamic and interactive web application developed using the MERN stack. The application seamlessly integrates front-end and back-end components to provide a robust user experience. It features efficient data storage and retrieval for posts and user data through a well-designed MongoDB schema. Additionally, Google Firebase is integrated to handle the storage of photos and videos, enhancing the application's multimedia capabilities and ensuring robust media management. The implementation of pagination for posts further optimizes content loading and provides smoother navigation through the application.
